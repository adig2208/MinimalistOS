## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **minimalist system execution environment**, focusing on **direct system calls, ELF file loading, and manual context switching**. It demonstrates how modern operating systems invoke system calls, manage processes, and switch execution contexts without relying on standard libraries.

The project is built in **C and GNU Assembly (AT&T syntax)** and operates on **x86_64 Linux**, making it a perfect learning experience for low-level systems programming.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- **Raw System Calls**: Implements `read()`, `write()`, and `exit()` without the standard C library.  
- **ELF File Loader**: Parses and loads executable binaries into memory.  
- **Minimalist Shell**: Reads user input and executes micro-programs in a controlled environment.  
- **Manual Context Switching**: Implements basic threading using direct stack manipulation and function pointers.  
- **Process Execution**: Simulates a microkernel-style execution model for user-defined programs.
